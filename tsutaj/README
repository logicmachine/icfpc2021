## tsutaj's solution

Since we have to keep edge-length rules, I researched how to deal with. During the research, I found "Verlet's Algorithm" [1], so I wrote a solution using this algorithm.

My solution is based on Simulated Annealing. Procedures are shown below:

- Find a initial solution
  - Using parallel transport only. A solution which gain the highest score is set as initial solution.
- Find a neighbor solution
  - We find next solution by moving some pose vertices.
- Output the answer
  - Finally we do parallel transport again, and set a solution which gain highest score is set as final solution.

However, this does not seem to work well. Eventually I found a solution by hand using JiroTech's tool.
